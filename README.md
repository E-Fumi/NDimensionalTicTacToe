# Disclaimer

This was my first project that was large enough to split into separate scripts.
It is here because I think it showcases a nice idea, but it is no longer representative of the way I write code.

# Requirements

python 3.x <br/>
numpy<br/>
pygame

# Usage

`git clone https://github.com/E-Fumi/NDimensionalTicTacToe.git`<br/>
`cd NDimensionalTicTacToe`<br/>
`pip install -r requirements.txt`<br/>
`python main.py`
